### Currently abandoned

Content aggregator and API for eSports statistics using Kimono Labs.

Uses Kimono Labs to scrape gosugamers.net for eSports statistics (mostly Dota 2 right now). Exposes a JSON API designed to minimize network traffic for a smartphone app.

I wrote this at a 24-hour hackathon, so it's pretty much garbage right now. I don't currently plan to improve it.
